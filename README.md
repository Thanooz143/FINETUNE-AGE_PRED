This repository implements an age prediction system using a pretrained ResNet18 model, fine-tuned for regression. It includes training, validation, and testing pipelines, along with preprocessing steps and prediction visualization for single images.

Features

1.Pretrained ResNet18 Model: Leverages transfer learning for age prediction with optimized fine-tuning.

2.Custom Training: Fine-tunes only specific layers (layer4 and fc) to prevent overfitting and accelerate training.

3.Regression Task: Predicts a single continuous output, representing the age of individuals.

4.Validation & Error Metrics: Evaluates model performance using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and RMS error.

5.Image Testing Pipeline: Predicts the age of any external image and visualizes the resul
